# Analysis software for _Optically accessible high-finesse millimeter-wave resonator for cavity quantum electrodynamics with atom arrays_

This repository contains analysis code for the paper entitled
_Optically accessible high-finesse millimeter-wave resonator for cavity quantum electrodynamics with atom arrays_
([arXiv:2506.05804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05804)).
The code herein generates all the figures shown in the main text and supplementary material,
and additionally shows how to analyze the raw data.
We have tested this software with Python 3.12.

Please direct any questions to <txz@stanford.edu>


## Quickstart

In a Python environment of your choice:
- Clone and install the `suprtools` repository, which contains much general analysis code.
- Decompress `data.zip` (the raw data) from Zenodo [10.5281/zenodo.16907261] into a `data` directory at the same level as this README.
- Run the entire notebook entitled `analysis.ipynb`.
    - If you have no local LaTeX installation, change the following line in the notebook before runnning
      so that matplotlib does not try to use LaTeX for rendering figure text:
        ```python
        setup_paper_style(usetex=False)  # previously, usetex=True
        ```

## Contents

- `analysis.ipynb`: main analysis notebook
- `img`: images used in the notebook
- `intermediate-data`: intermediate results that take a long time to generate.
    - Presently these are in the form of `.pickle` files that are already provided.
    - These files may be regenerated by running the entireties of the three analysis notebooks:
        - `caecilia-renalaysis.ipynb`
        - `cassia-reanalysis.ipynb`
        - `flaminia-reanalysis.ipynb`
- `paper_figures`: additional code that is imported in the main notebook (`analysis.ipynb`)
- `README.md`: this README
